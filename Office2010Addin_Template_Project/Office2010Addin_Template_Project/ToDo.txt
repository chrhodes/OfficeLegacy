Using the Office2010Addin_Template_Project template
----------------------------------------------
Some template variables do not expand correctly.  The following changes need to be made before
the template will compile:

1. Change $rootnamespace$ in Resources.Designer.vb to the root namespace of the solution.  See Project/Properties for correct value.
   The values should be quoted, e.g.: "MyRootNameSpace"
2. Change $rootnamespace$ in Settings.Designer.vb to the root namespace of the solution.

The template will now compile, however, you may want to also change the following:

3. Change Excel_Addin_With_Task_Panes_Template in Ribbon.vb to the root namespace of the solution.
   The value should be a string.
4. Change "CustomTaskPanes" and "Custom Task Panes" in Riboon.xml.  The other buttons will likely change
   depending on your application.
5. Update Globals.vb as appropriate.  THe first few Public Constants should be updated at a minimum.
   Update NEWAPPNAME.
6. Update NEWAPPNAME in App.Config logging to reflect the name chosen in Globals.
7. Globaly rename
